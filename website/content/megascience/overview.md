**Medium Bands: Mega Science** is a JWST Cycle 2 public survey that will obtain deep NIRCam multiband imaging of the Frontier Field Abell 2744, building on existing imaging from the Cycle 1 Treasury Program UNCOVER. MegaScience includes observations in all dozen of NIRCam's medium-band filters, as well as the two bluest broad-band filters F070W and F090W.


Thanks to the strong lensing boost, deep observations, and dense photometric coverage (20 bands!), MegaScience will be uniquely positioned to (1) improve our understanding of the redshifts and stellar population properties of distant galaxies, and (2) map strong emission features across a wide redshift range from the cluster itself through the epoch of reionization. 

These data will allow us to understand where stars form within galaxies, the incidence and distribution of star-forming clumps, spatial variations in dust, and perform a wide range of ancillary science from identification and characterization of AGN through modeling NIRSpec slit losses.
