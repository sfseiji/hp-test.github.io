New DR3 photometric catalog and mosaics from the MegaScience survey are now 
available, as presented in [Suess et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240413132S/abstract)!

These are based on all JWST+HST imaging over the extended Abell 2744 
cluster footprint, including MegaScience and UNCOVER as 
well as a number of other programs. 

See the [Data Release 3 page](/DR3.html) and the catalog paper ([Suess et al. 2024](URL)) for full details!
